# Extreme Edge Case Mock Workflows

## Example 22: Circular Dependency Analysis

### Analytic Goal
"Analyze company ownership where companies own parts of each other in complex cycles."

### Challenge
Circular references in graph analysis can cause infinite loops or incorrect calculations.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Discover Circular Ownership
Company A owns 30% of Company B
Company B owns 25% of Company C  
Company C owns 20% of Company A
→ Circular ownership!

Graph Representation:
{
  "edges": [
    {"from": "A", "to": "B", "ownership": 0.30},
    {"from": "B", "to": "C", "ownership": 0.25},
    {"from": "C", "to": "A", "ownership": 0.20}
  ],
  "cycle_detected": true,
  "cycle_path": ["A", "B", "C", "A"]
}

Step 2: Calculate Effective Ownership
Problem: Traditional ownership calculation would infinitely loop!
A owns B, but B indirectly owns A through C...

Solution: Eigenvalue-based calculation
{
  "calculation_method": "eigenvector_centrality",
  "max_iterations": 1000,
  "convergence_threshold": 0.0001,
  "results": {
    "A": {"self_ownership": 0.05, "external_ownership": 0.95},
    "B": {"self_ownership": 0.075, "external_ownership": 0.925},
    "C": {"self_ownership": 0.06, "external_ownership": 0.94}
  },
  "convergence_achieved": true,
  "iterations_needed": 47
}

Step 3: Regulatory Compliance Check
Some jurisdictions limit circular ownership:

{
  "compliance_check": {
    "jurisdiction": "EU",
    "rule": "No circular ownership exceeding 50% total",
    "calculation": "A→B→C→A = 0.30 * 0.25 * 0.20 = 0.015 (1.5%)",
    "status": "COMPLIANT",
    "warning": "Complex structure may require detailed disclosure"
  }
}

Step 4: Break Cycle for Certain Analyses
Some algorithms require DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):

{
  "dag_conversion": {
    "method": "minimum_feedback_arc_set",
    "removed_edges": [{"from": "C", "to": "A", "ownership": 0.20}],
    "justification": "Smallest ownership percentage",
    "analysis_note": "Results approximate due to cycle breaking"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Cycle detection in graphs
- Iterative algorithms with convergence checking
- Multiple graph representations (cyclic vs DAG)
- Analysis-specific graph transformations
```

## Example 23: Extreme Cardinality Relationships

### Analytic Goal
"Analyze social media where one influencer has 10 million followers and posts have millions of likes."

### Challenge
Extreme one-to-many relationships that break typical graph visualizations and algorithms.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Detect Extreme Cardinality
{
  "entity": "influencer_001",
  "relationship_counts": {
    "follows": 10000000,  // 10M followers
    "likes": 50000000,    // 50M total likes on posts
    "comments": 5000000   // 5M comments
  },
  "classification": "EXTREME_HIGH_DEGREE_NODE"
}

Step 2: Sampling Strategy for Analysis
Can't process all 10M relationships directly:

{
  "sampling_strategy": {
    "method": "stratified_sampling",
    "strata": [
      {"type": "verified_followers", "sample_rate": 0.1},
      {"type": "active_followers", "sample_rate": 0.05},
      {"type": "inactive_followers", "sample_rate": 0.001}
    ],
    "total_sampled": 50000,
    "representation_quality": 0.92
  }
}

Step 3: Specialized Storage for High-Degree Nodes
{
  "storage_strategy": {
    "node_type": "HIGH_DEGREE",
    "approach": "EDGE_PARTITIONING",
    "partitions": [
      {"range": "follower_0_to_1M", "storage": "neo4j_shard_1"},
      {"range": "follower_1M_to_2M", "storage": "neo4j_shard_2"},
      // ... up to 10 shards
    ],
    "query_strategy": "parallel_then_merge"
  }
}

Step 4: Modified Algorithms for Extreme Nodes
Standard PageRank would over-weight the influencer:

{
  "algorithm_modification": {
    "standard_pagerank": {
      "influencer_001": 0.45,  // Dominates entire graph!
      "everyone_else": 0.000001
    },
    "modified_pagerank": {
      "method": "degree_normalized_pagerank",
      "influencer_001": 0.08,  // More reasonable
      "other_influencers": 0.02-0.05
    }
  }
}

Step 5: Hierarchical Aggregation
Instead of individual followers, aggregate:

{
  "hierarchical_representation": {
    "influencer_001": {
      "follower_segments": [
        {"segment": "verified_accounts", "count": 50000, "avg_engagement": 0.15},
        {"segment": "active_users", "count": 2000000, "avg_engagement": 0.05},
        {"segment": "passive_followers", "count": 7950000, "avg_engagement": 0.001}
      ]
    }
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- High-degree node detection and handling
- Sampling strategies for extreme cardinality
- Partitioned storage for large edge sets
- Algorithm modifications for skewed distributions
- Hierarchical aggregation patterns
```

## Example 24: Temporal Paradox Resolution

### Analytic Goal
"Analyze historical events where sources disagree on dates, creating temporal impossibilities."

### Challenge
Different sources claim contradictory timelines that create logical paradoxes.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Detect Temporal Conflict
Source 1: "Company A acquired Company B in January 2020"
Source 2: "Company B acquired Company C in March 2019"
Source 3: "Company C was a subsidiary of Company A since 2018"

Paradox: C can't be subsidiary of A before A owns B!

{
  "temporal_conflicts": [
    {
      "type": "acquisition_paradox",
      "conflict": "C subsidiary of A (2018) before A→B→C chain (2020)",
      "sources": ["doc_001", "doc_002", "doc_003"]
    }
  ]
}

Step 2: Build Temporal Constraint Graph
{
  "constraints": [
    {"event": "A_acquires_B", "after": null, "before": "B_acquires_C"},
    {"event": "B_acquires_C", "after": "A_acquires_B", "before": null},
    {"event": "C_subsidiary_of_A", "requires": "A_owns_C"}
  ],
  "constraint_violation": true
}

Step 3: Resolution Strategies
{
  "resolution_attempts": [
    {
      "strategy": "source_reliability",
      "analysis": {
        "doc_001": {"type": "news_article", "reliability": 0.7},
        "doc_002": {"type": "SEC_filing", "reliability": 0.95},
        "doc_003": {"type": "blog_post", "reliability": 0.4}
      },
      "resolution": "Trust doc_002 (SEC filing) over others"
    },
    {
      "strategy": "partial_truth",
      "hypothesis": "C was informally affiliated with A before formal acquisition",
      "modified_timeline": {
        "2018": "C affiliated with A (informal)",
        "2019": "B acquires C (formal)",
        "2020": "A acquires B (C becomes subsidiary via B)"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Step 4: Multi-Timeline Representation
When conflicts can't be resolved:

{
  "multi_timeline": {
    "timeline_v1": {
      "source": "official_records",
      "events": [{"date": "2020-01", "event": "A→B"}],
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    "timeline_v2": {
      "source": "news_reports",
      "events": [{"date": "2019-06", "event": "A→B"}],
      "confidence": 0.60
    },
    "analysis_note": "Multiple timelines preserved for sensitivity analysis"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Temporal constraint satisfaction
- Paradox detection and resolution
- Multi-timeline representation
- Source reliability weighting in conflicts
- Partial truth hypothesis generation
```

## Example 25: Negative Information and Absence Analysis

### Analytic Goal
"Identify companies that have NEVER had data breaches by analyzing what's NOT mentioned."

### Challenge
Proving absence of information, handling negative relationships.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Universe Definition
First, define what companies we're checking:
{
  "universe": "All S&P 500 companies from 2015-2024",
  "total_companies": 500,
  "time_period": "10 years"
}

Step 2: Positive Evidence Collection
Find all mentioned data breaches:
{
  "mentioned_breaches": [
    {"company": "Equifax", "year": 2017, "severity": "major"},
    {"company": "Target", "year": 2013, "severity": "major"},
    // ... 127 total companies with breaches
  ]
}

Step 3: Absence Verification Challenge
For remaining 373 companies, how do we know they had NO breaches?

{
  "absence_verification": {
    "method_1": {
      "approach": "explicit_negation_search",
      "search_terms": ["no breaches", "breach-free", "perfect security record"],
      "found": 12,
      "confidence": "HIGH - explicit statement"
    },
    "method_2": {
      "approach": "comprehensive_source_coverage",
      "sources_checked": ["SEC filings", "major news", "breach databases"],
      "companies_verified": 245,
      "confidence": "MEDIUM - absence in comprehensive sources"
    },
    "method_3": {
      "approach": "insufficient_data",
      "companies": 116,
      "confidence": "LOW - cannot confirm absence"
    }
  }
}

Step 4: Negative Relationship Representation
{
  "negative_relationships": [
    {
      "type": "NEVER_HAD",
      "source": "company_001",
      "target": "data_breach",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence_type": "explicit_negation",
      "last_verified": "2024-01-15"
    },
    {
      "type": "NOT_MENTIONED_IN",
      "source": "company_002",
      "target": "breach_databases",
      "confidence": 0.70,
      "note": "Absence of evidence, not evidence of absence"
    }
  ]
}

Step 5: Temporal Validity of Absence
Absence claims expire over time:

{
  "absence_decay": {
    "claim": "Company X has never had a breach",
    "made_on": "2024-01-15",
    "validity_periods": [
      {"days": 0-30, "confidence": 0.95},
      {"days": 31-90, "confidence": 0.85},
      {"days": 91-365, "confidence": 0.70},
      {"days": "365+", "confidence": 0.50}
    ],
    "reason": "Absence claims become less reliable over time"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Negative relationship representation
- Absence verification strategies
- Confidence levels for negative information
- Temporal decay of absence claims
- Universe definition for completeness checking
```

## Example 26: Emergent Property Detection

### Analytic Goal
"Identify emerging tech hubs by detecting when multiple weak signals combine into strong patterns."

### Challenge
Individual signals are weak, but combination indicates emergence.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Weak Signal Collection
Individual indicators that aren't significant alone:

{
  "weak_signals": [
    {"city": "Austin", "signal": "3 new AI startups", "strength": 0.2},
    {"city": "Austin", "signal": "University AI program expansion", "strength": 0.15},
    {"city": "Austin", "signal": "Tech giant satellite office", "strength": 0.25},
    {"city": "Austin", "signal": "AI conference scheduled", "strength": 0.1},
    {"city": "Austin", "signal": "VC fund opened office", "strength": 0.2}
  ]
}

Step 2: Signal Combination Rules
{
  "combination_rules": [
    {
      "rule": "startup_ecosystem",
      "requires": ["startups", "VC", "university"],
      "threshold": 0.5,
      "multiplier": 1.5  // Synergy bonus
    },
    {
      "rule": "critical_mass",
      "requires": ["min_5_signals"],
      "threshold": 0.7,
      "emergence_indicator": true
    }
  ]
}

Step 3: Emergent Pattern Detection
{
  "emergence_analysis": {
    "city": "Austin",
    "individual_signal_avg": 0.18,  // Below threshold
    "combined_signal_score": 0.85,   // Above threshold!
    "synergy_effects": [
      "startups + VC = funding ecosystem",
      "university + conference = talent pipeline",
      "tech giant + startups = mentorship"
    ],
    "classification": "EMERGING_TECH_HUB",
    "confidence": 0.82
  }
}

Step 4: Temporal Emergence Tracking
When did it become a hub?

{
  "emergence_timeline": {
    "2022-Q1": {"score": 0.3, "status": "weak_signals"},
    "2022-Q3": {"score": 0.5, "status": "approaching_threshold"},
    "2023-Q1": {"score": 0.75, "status": "emergence_detected"},
    "2023-Q3": {"score": 0.85, "status": "confirmed_hub"},
    "inflection_point": "2023-Q1",
    "time_to_emergence": "12 months"
  }
}

Step 5: Comparative Emergence
Compare to other cities:

{
  "comparative_emergence": {
    "austin": {"current": 0.85, "trajectory": "rising", "velocity": 0.15/quarter},
    "denver": {"current": 0.65, "trajectory": "rising", "velocity": 0.10/quarter},
    "miami": {"current": 0.70, "trajectory": "plateau", "velocity": 0.02/quarter},
    "prediction": "Austin will reach 'established hub' (>0.9) in 2 quarters"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Weak signal aggregation
- Synergy effect calculation
- Emergence threshold detection
- Temporal trajectory tracking
- Comparative emergence analysis
```

## Example 27: Contradiction-Driven Discovery

### Analytic Goal
"Find breakthrough insights by identifying where expert consensus is wrong."

### Challenge
System must identify when contradictions might indicate new knowledge rather than errors.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Establish Consensus Baseline
{
  "consensus_belief": {
    "statement": "Coffee consumption increases heart disease risk",
    "source_count": 45,
    "expert_agreement": 0.89,
    "time_period": "1990-2010",
    "confidence": "HIGH"
  }
}

Step 2: Identify Contradicting Evidence
{
  "contradictions": [
    {
      "source": "study_2018_001",
      "finding": "Moderate coffee consumption reduces heart disease by 15%",
      "methodology_score": 0.95,
      "sample_size": 500000
    },
    {
      "source": "study_2019_045", 
      "finding": "Coffee protective against cardiovascular disease",
      "methodology_score": 0.92,
      "sample_size": 300000
    }
  ]
}

Step 3: Evaluate Contradiction Quality
Not all contradictions are equal:

{
  "contradiction_evaluation": {
    "methodology_comparison": {
      "consensus_studies": {"avg_methodology_score": 0.72, "avg_sample": 5000},
      "contradicting_studies": {"avg_methodology_score": 0.93, "avg_sample": 400000}
    },
    "temporal_factor": {
      "consensus_period": "1990-2010",
      "contradiction_period": "2018-2024",
      "advancement_note": "Better statistical methods, larger cohorts"
    },
    "quality_assessment": "Contradictions appear MORE reliable than consensus"
  }
}

Step 4: Paradigm Shift Detection
{
  "paradigm_shift_indicators": [
    {
      "indicator": "methodology_improvement",
      "old": "Small observational studies",
      "new": "Large cohort with genetic markers",
      "impact": "Confounding factors better controlled"
    },
    {
      "indicator": "new_mechanism_discovered",
      "discovery": "Coffee antioxidants protect endothelium",
      "year": 2017,
      "explains_contradiction": true
    }
  ],
  "shift_confidence": 0.87,
  "recommendation": "Update knowledge base - consensus appears outdated"
}

Step 5: Knowledge Evolution Tracking
{
  "knowledge_evolution": {
    "topic": "coffee_health_effects",
    "versions": [
      {"period": "1990-2010", "belief": "harmful", "confidence": 0.89},
      {"period": "2010-2017", "belief": "mixed", "confidence": 0.45},
      {"period": "2018-2024", "belief": "beneficial", "confidence": 0.78}
    ],
    "current_frontier": "Optimal dosage and genetic factors",
    "controversy_level": "MEDIUM",
    "next_review": "2025-Q2"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Consensus establishment and tracking
- Contradiction quality scoring
- Paradigm shift detection
- Knowledge evolution versioning
- Methodology improvement tracking
```
