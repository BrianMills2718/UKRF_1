# Super-Digimon Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 6, 2025  
**Status**: Documentation Cleanup In Progress

## Executive Summary

Super-Digimon is a GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system specification with partial implementation. The project is currently undergoing documentation cleanup to clarify what exists versus what is planned.

## Current Implementation State

### ‚úÖ What Actually Exists

1. **Neo4j Integration**
   - Working Neo4j connection code (`test_neo4j_working.py`)
   - Docker setup for Neo4j with GDS plugin
   - Basic graph operations tested

2. **CC_Automator V2** (Separate Tool)
   - Autonomous code generation system
   - Has completed milestones M1-M5 for a GraphRAG project
   - Located in `cc_automator/` directory
   - Not directly integrated with Super-Digimon

3. **Test Data**
   - Celestial Council dataset in `test_data/celestial_council/`
   - Small, medium, and large dataset generators
   - Sample queries and verification scripts

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive specifications (though inconsistent)
   - Architecture designs
   - Tool specifications

### ‚ùå What Does NOT Exist (Yet)

1. **Super-Digimon Implementation**
   - No actual Python implementation of the 26 core tools
   - No MCP server implementation
   - No working ReAct agent
   - No query processing pipeline

2. **Removed/Archived Implementations**
   - CC2 (digimon_scratch_cc2) - Deleted
   - StructGPT - Deleted
   - GraphRAG_fresh - Deleted
   - These were separate projects, not Super-Digimon implementations

3. **Integration Components**
   - No MCP compatibility layer implementation
   - No blackboard system
   - No tool orchestration code

## Tool Count Clarification

**Official Tool Count: 26 Core Tools (T01-T26)**

These are the fundamental GraphRAG operators:
- T01-T15: Basic GraphRAG operations
- T16-T26: Advanced operators

The "106 tools" mentioned in some docs refers to a future vision including:
- 26 core tools
- 30 extended tools (data ingestion, multi-format support)
- 30 cross-domain tools (specialized algorithms)
- 20 integration tools (external systems)

**Current Implementation: 0 of 26 tools**

## Project Relationships

### Super-Digimon
- The main project: A GraphRAG system specification
- Status: Design phase, no implementation
- Goal: Build from scratch using specifications

### CC_Automator
- A separate tool for autonomous AI development
- Has been used to explore GraphRAG implementations
- The M1-M5 milestones in cc_automator/docs/ are from its GraphRAG experiments
- Not a component of Super-Digimon, but a potential development tool

### Archived Projects (Deleted)
- **CC2**: A GraphRAG implementation that achieved high tool coverage
- **StructGPT**: A structured data query system
- **GraphRAG_fresh**: Another GraphRAG implementation attempt
- These were removed to avoid confusion and start fresh

## Architecture Decision

**Current Architecture**: Specification only, no implementation

**Planned Architecture**:
1. Python-based tool implementations
2. MCP server for Claude Code integration
3. Neo4j for graph storage
4. ReAct agent for orchestration

**Storage**: Neo4j (decided, Docker setup exists)

**Development Approach**: From-scratch implementation based on specifications

## Next Steps

### Immediate (In Progress)
1. ‚úÖ Create this STATUS.md file
2. üîÑ Fix documentation inconsistencies
3. üîÑ Remove references to deleted projects

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Create minimal working example
2. Implement first tool (T01_DocumentLoader)
3. Set up basic MCP server

### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. Implement core tools (T01-T15)
2. Create ReAct agent
3. Build query processing pipeline

## How to Contribute

Currently, the project needs:
1. Documentation cleanup (in progress)
2. Basic tool implementations
3. MCP server setup
4. Testing infrastructure

## Version Information

- Super-Digimon: v0.0.1 (pre-implementation)
- CC_Automator: v2.0 (separate tool)
