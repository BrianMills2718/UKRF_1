# Advanced Mock Workflow Scenarios

## Example 16: Recursive Analysis with Self-Reference

### Analytic Goal
"Analyze academic papers about graph analysis to improve our own graph analysis methods."

### Challenge
The system analyzing papers about systems like itself - meta-analysis with potential infinite loops.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Ingest Graph Analysis Papers
Papers include: "Comparing GraphRAG Systems", "Entity Resolution in Knowledge Graphs"
These papers describe methods we're using!

Step 2: Extract Methods Mentioned
Tool: T24 (Custom Entity Recognizer for Methods)
Output:
entities: [
  {
    "id": "method_pagerank_001",
    "name": "PageRank",
    "type": "Algorithm",
    "description_from_paper": "PageRank computes node importance..."
  },
  {
    "id": "method_entity_resolution_001",
    "name": "Entity Resolution",
    "type": "Technique",
    "description_from_paper": "Matching different surface forms..."
  }
]

Step 3: Self-Recognition Problem
The system recognizes it's using these same methods!

Self-Reference Challenge:
{
  "tool_id": "T68",
  "tool_name": "PageRank",
  "matches_entity": "method_pagerank_001",
  "recursive_issue": "Analyzing papers about PageRank while using PageRank"
}

Step 4: Recursive Improvement
Paper suggests: "PageRank with temporal decay improves results"
System question: "Should I modify my own T68 based on this?"

Meta-Analysis Loop:
1. Extract improvement suggestions
2. Evaluate against current implementation
3. Generate self-modification recommendations
4. But DON'T auto-modify (dangerous!)

Output:
{
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    {
      "current_tool": "T68",
      "suggested_enhancement": "Add temporal decay parameter",
      "source_paper": "doc_001",
      "confidence": 0.82,
      "auto_apply": false,  // Never auto-modify!
      "requires_human_review": true
    }
  ]
}

Key Requirements Discovered:
- Need to recognize when analyzing descriptions of own methods
- Prevent infinite recursion (analyzing analysis of analysis...)
- Clear boundaries on self-modification
- Meta-level awareness in the system
```

## Example 17: Multi-Language Entity Alignment

### Analytic Goal
"Build unified knowledge graph from documents in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic about the same companies."

### Challenge
Same entity has different names/scripts, different cultural contexts affect descriptions.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Multi-Language Ingestion
- English: "Apple Inc. announced..."
- Chinese: "苹果公司宣布..." (Píngguǒ gōngsī)
- Spanish: "Apple Inc. anunció..."
- Arabic: "أعلنت شركة أبل..." (A'lanat sharikat 'abl)

Step 2: Language-Specific Entity Recognition
Tool: T24 with language-specific models

Challenge: Different extraction results per language!
{
  "english_entities": ["Apple Inc.", "Tim Cook", "iPhone 15"],
  "chinese_entities": ["苹果公司", "库克", "iPhone 15"],  // Note: Cook in Chinese
  "spanish_entities": ["Apple Inc.", "Tim Cook", "iPhone 15"],
  "arabic_entities": ["أبل", "تيم كوك", "آيفون 15"]
}

Step 3: Cross-Language Entity Resolution
Problem: How to know "Apple Inc." = "苹果公司" = "أبل"?

Solution Approaches:
1. Translation-based:
   {
     "entity_id": "ent_apple_001",
     "names": {
       "en": "Apple Inc.",
       "zh": "苹果公司",
       "es": "Apple Inc.",
       "ar": "أبل"
     },
     "alignment_method": "translation",
     "confidence": 0.90
   }

2. Context-based:
   All mention "iPhone" (or translations) nearby
   All mention similar financial figures
   Confidence: 0.95

3. External knowledge base:
   Link to Wikidata: Q312
   Has labels in all languages
   Confidence: 0.99

Step 4: Cultural Context Challenges
Chinese text: "苹果公司在春节期间..." (during Spring Festival)
English text: "Apple during Q1..."
Same time period, different cultural framing!

Temporal Alignment:
{
  "event": "sales_announcement",
  "temporal_references": [
    {"lang": "zh", "text": "春节期间", "normalized": "2024-02-10/2024-02-17"},
    {"lang": "en", "text": "Q1", "normalized": "2024-01-01/2024-03-31"}
  ],
  "overlap": true,
  "cultural_note": "Spring Festival is within Q1"
}

Step 5: Build Unified Graph
Challenges in relationship extraction:
- Formality levels differ by language
- Some relationships only mentioned in certain languages
- Different cultural emphasis

Unified Entity:
{
  "id": "ent_apple_001",
  "preferred_names": {
    "en": "Apple Inc.",
    "zh": "苹果公司",
    "es": "Apple Inc.",
    "ar": "أبل"
  },
  "relationships": [
    {
      "type": "manufactures",
      "target": "ent_iphone_15",
      "sources": ["en_doc", "zh_doc", "es_doc", "ar_doc"],
      "confidence": 1.0
    },
    {
      "type": "celebrates",  // Only from Chinese source!
      "target": "event_spring_festival",
      "sources": ["zh_doc"],
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "cultural_specific": true
    }
  ]
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Multi-language name management per entity
- Cultural context preservation
- Language-specific confidence scores
- Cross-language temporal alignment
- Handling culture-specific relationships
```

## Example 18: Real-Time Constraint Satisfaction

### Analytic Goal
"Find investment opportunities that satisfy complex, changing constraints as market data updates."

### Challenge
Constraints change during analysis, partial results may become invalid.

### Workflow

```yaml
Initial Constraints (T=0):
{
  "min_market_cap": "$1B",
  "max_pe_ratio": 25,
  "sectors": ["tech", "healthcare"],
  "esg_score": ">70"
}

Step 1-3: Build Initial Graph
[Standard ingestion, entity extraction, graph building]
Found 847 companies, 127 match constraints

Step 4: During Analysis (T=30min)
Market update: Tech sector crash!
User updates constraints:

Updated Constraints (T=30):
{
  "min_market_cap": "$500M",  // Lowered
  "max_pe_ratio": 20,         // More strict
  "sectors": ["healthcare", "utilities"],  // No more tech!
  "esg_score": ">70"
}

Problem: Current analysis includes tech companies!

Step 5: Incremental Constraint Application
Don't restart from scratch!

Incremental Update:
{
  "previous_results": 127 companies,
  "constraint_changes": [
    {"type": "modified", "field": "min_market_cap", "old": "1B", "new": "500M"},
    {"type": "modified", "field": "max_pe_ratio", "old": 25, "new": 20},
    {"type": "removed", "field": "sectors", "value": "tech"},
    {"type": "added", "field": "sectors", "value": "utilities"}
  ],
  "revalidation_strategy": "incremental"
}

Step 6: Differential Results
Instead of just new results, show changes:

{
  "results_diff": {
    "removed": [
      {"company": "Apple", "reason": "sector=tech"},
      {"company": "Microsoft", "reason": "sector=tech"}
    ],
    "still_valid": [
      {"company": "Johnson & Johnson", "unchanged": true}
    ],
    "newly_qualified": [
      {"company": "NextEra Energy", "reason": "sector=utilities now included"}
    ],
    "almost_qualified": [
      {"company": "Moderna", "missing": "PE ratio 20.5 > 20"}
    ]
  }
}

Step 7: Continuous Monitoring Mode
Watch for changes that affect results:
- Market cap fluctuations
- PE ratio updates
- ESG score changes

Alert Pattern:
{
  "alert_id": "alert_001",
  "trigger": "Pfizer market cap dropped below $500M",
  "effect": "No longer meets constraints",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:45:00Z",
  "current_result_count": 125  // Was 126
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Constraint versioning and diffing
- Incremental revalidation
- Results with explanations
- "Almost qualified" tracking
- Real-time monitoring hooks
```

## Example 19: Hypothesis Testing with Counterfactuals

### Analytic Goal
"Test hypothesis: 'Tech companies with diverse leadership have better ESG scores' and explore counterfactuals."

### Challenge
Need to track hypothesis evolution, test multiple variations, and explore "what-if" scenarios.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Hypothesis Registration
{
  "hypothesis_id": "hyp_001",
  "statement": "Tech companies with diverse leadership have better ESG scores",
  "variables": {
    "independent": "leadership_diversity_score",
    "dependent": "esg_score",
    "control": ["company_size", "company_age", "sector_subsegment"]
  },
  "confidence_required": 0.95
}

Step 2: Operationalization Challenges
What is "diverse leadership"? Different papers define differently!

{
  "concept": "leadership_diversity",
  "operationalizations": [
    {
      "source": "paper_001",
      "definition": "% women in C-suite",
      "entities_with_data": 423
    },
    {
      "source": "paper_002", 
      "definition": "% ethnic minorities on board",
      "entities_with_data": 367
    },
    {
      "source": "paper_003",
      "definition": "composite diversity index",
      "entities_with_data": 289
    }
  ],
  "selected_approach": "run_all_three"
}

Step 3: Multi-Definition Analysis
Run same hypothesis with different operationalizations:

Results:
{
  "hypothesis_id": "hyp_001",
  "results_by_definition": [
    {
      "definition": "% women",
      "correlation": 0.72,
      "p_value": 0.001,
      "n": 423,
      "conclusion": "supported"
    },
    {
      "definition": "% minorities",
      "correlation": 0.45,
      "p_value": 0.08,
      "n": 367,
      "conclusion": "not supported"
    }
  ],
  "sensitivity_note": "Results highly sensitive to operationalization"
}

Step 4: Counterfactual Exploration
"What if we excluded California companies (potential bias)?"

Counterfactual Framework:
{
  "base_analysis": "hyp_001",
  "counterfactuals": [
    {
      "id": "cf_001",
      "modification": "exclude companies where state='CA'",
      "rationale": "CA has both high diversity mandates and high ESG requirements",
      "result": {
        "correlation": 0.31,
        "p_value": 0.15,
        "conclusion": "relationship disappears!",
        "insight": "CA policy may drive observed correlation"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "cf_002",
      "modification": "only companies > 10 years old",
      "rationale": "Test if relationship exists in established companies",
      "result": {
        "correlation": 0.68,
        "p_value": 0.002,
        "conclusion": "still supported"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Step 5: Hypothesis Evolution
Based on counterfactuals, refine hypothesis:

{
  "hypothesis_v2": {
    "id": "hyp_001_v2",
    "statement": "Tech companies with diverse leadership have better ESG scores, mediated by state policy environment",
    "parent": "hyp_001",
    "refinement_reason": "Counterfactual analysis showed state effects"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Hypothesis versioning and evolution
- Multiple operationalization tracking
- Counterfactual framework
- Sensitivity analysis built-in
- Causal assumption tracking
```

## Example 20: Federated Analysis Across Privacy Boundaries

### Analytic Goal
"Analyze patient outcomes across multiple hospitals without sharing raw patient data."

### Challenge
Data can't leave institutional boundaries, but need unified analysis.

### Workflow

```yaml
Step 1: Federated Entity Recognition
Each hospital runs locally:

Hospital A:
{
  "local_analysis": {
    "patient_count": 10000,
    "condition_distribution": {
      "diabetes": 0.23,
      "hypertension": 0.45
    },
    "outcome_summary": {
      "mean_readmission_rate": 0.12
    }
  },
  "shared_data": "aggregates_only"
}

Hospital B:
{
  "local_analysis": {
    "patient_count": 15000,
    "condition_distribution": {
      "diabetes": 0.19,
      "hypertension": 0.52
    },
    "outcome_summary": {
      "mean_readmission_rate": 0.15
    }
  },
  "shared_data": "aggregates_only"
}

Step 2: Privacy-Preserving Entity Matching
Need to know if same treatment protocols without sharing patient data:

Secure Protocol Matching:
{
  "protocol_hash": "hash(treatment_protocol)",
  "hospitals_using": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "outcome_comparison": "permitted",
  "patient_level_data": "never_shared"
}

Step 3: Differential Privacy in Aggregation
Add noise to protect individual privacy:

{
  "true_count": 523,
  "reported_count": 520,  // +/- noise
  "privacy_budget": 0.1,
  "confidence_interval": [515, 525]
}

Step 4: Federated Graph Building
Build knowledge graph without centralizing data:

{
  "federated_graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "treatment_protocol_001",
        "hospitals": ["A", "B"],
        "aggregate_outcomes": {
          "mean_success_rate": 0.73,
          "n": 2500,
          "privacy_noise_added": true
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "type": "improves_condition",
        "source": "treatment_protocol_001",
        "target": "condition_diabetes",
        "confidence": 0.81,
        "based_on": "federated_analysis"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Step 5: Audit Trail for Compliance
Track what was shared:

{
  "audit_entry": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "hospital": "A",
    "data_shared": [
      "aggregate_readmission_rate",
      "protocol_hashes",
      "condition_distribution"
    ],
    "data_not_shared": [
      "patient_ids",
      "individual_outcomes",
      "raw_records"
    ],
    "privacy_method": "differential_privacy",
    "approved_by": "IRB_protocol_12345"
  }
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Federated analysis patterns
- Privacy budget tracking
- Differential privacy integration
- Audit trail for data sharing
- Aggregate-only entity definitions
```

## Example 21: Rapid Re-Analysis with Live Corrections

### Analytic Goal
"During a live presentation, stakeholders spot errors and need immediate re-analysis."

### Challenge
Quick corrections without full reprocessing, maintaining analysis narrative.

### Workflow

```yaml
Initial Analysis (presented at T=0):
"Microsoft's revenue grew 45% year-over-year"
Graph shows: Microsoft --[revenue_growth: 45%]--> 2024

Live Correction (T=5min):
Stakeholder: "That's wrong! It's 15%, not 45%"

Step 1: Rapid Correction Protocol
{
  "correction_request": {
    "entity": "Microsoft",
    "attribute": "revenue_growth_2024",
    "incorrect_value": "45%",
    "correct_value": "15%",
    "source": "CFO in meeting",
    "priority": "IMMEDIATE"
  }
}

Step 2: Impact Analysis in Real-Time
What conclusions depend on this?

{
  "impact_trace": {
    "direct_impacts": [
      "Slide 5: Growth comparison chart",
      "Slide 8: Sector leader analysis"
    ],
    "derived_impacts": [
      "Microsoft no longer fastest growing",
      "Sector average changes from 22% to 18%"
    ],
    "narrative_impacts": [
      "Conclusion about 'explosive growth' no longer valid"
    ]
  }
}

Step 3: Live Update Strategy
Don't regenerate everything, just affected parts:

{
  "update_plan": {
    "immediate": [
      "Update growth value in graph",
      "Recalculate sector average",
      "Flag affected slides"
    ],
    "deferred": [
      "Regenerate full report",
      "Update all visualizations",
      "Rerun statistical tests"
    ]
  }
}

Step 4: Presentation Mode
Show corrections transparently:

{
  "slide_annotation": {
    "original": "Microsoft leads with 45% growth",
    "corrected": "Microsoft shows solid 15% growth",
    "correction_time": "10:35 AM",
    "corrected_by": "Live input from CFO",
    "confidence": "Direct from source - 100%"
  }
}

Step 5: Correction Cascade
Some corrections trigger others:

{
  "cascade_corrections": [
    {
      "trigger": "Microsoft 45% → 15%",
      "causes": "Sector average 22% → 18%"
    },
    {
      "trigger": "Sector average 22% → 18%",
      "causes": "Market assessment 'hypergrowth' → 'steady growth'"
    }
  ]
}

Requirements Discovered:
- Live correction protocol
- Real-time impact analysis
- Presentation mode with annotations
- Correction cascade tracking
- Partial regeneration strategies
```

## Architectural Implications

### New Services Needed:

```python

    def detect_self_reference(analysis_target) -> bool
    def prevent_recursion(call_stack) -> bool
    def suggest_improvements(findings) -> List[Improvement]

    def apply_correction(entity, attribute, new_value) -> impact_analysis
    def cascade_updates(correction) -> affected_items
    def annotate_for_presentation(original, corrected) -> annotated
```

These advanced scenarios reveal that Super-Digimon needs even more sophisticated capabilities than initially envisioned, particularly around meta-analysis, multi-language support, dynamic constraints, hypothesis management, privacy preservation, and live corrections.
