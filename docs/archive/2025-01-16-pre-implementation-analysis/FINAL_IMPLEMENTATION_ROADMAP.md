## Implementation Principles

### 1. Every Tool Must:
```python
class ToolTemplate:
    def execute(self, input_refs: List[str], params: dict) -> dict:
        # 1. Validate inputs
        # 2. Load data from refs (streaming if needed)
        # 3. Process with quality tracking
        # 4. Store results, return refs
        # 5. Record provenance
        
        return {
            "output_refs": [...],
            "confidence": 0.85,
            "quality_tier": "high",
            "warnings": [],
            "metrics": {...},
            "provenance": {...}
        }
```

### 2. Quality First:
- No operation without confidence score
- Uncertainty propagates through pipeline
- Users can filter by quality threshold
- Partial results better than no results

### 3. Reference Architecture:
- Never pass full data between tools
- Storage systems handle persistence
- Tools work with data streams
- Graceful handling of large data

### 4. Provenance Everything:
- Every operation recorded
- Complete lineage tracking
- Reproducibility guaranteed
- Impact analysis possible

## Validation Milestones

- [ ] Can explain analysis steps
- [ ] Ready for thesis demonstration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Three-level identity complexity**
   - Mitigation: Build incrementally, test thoroughly
   
2. **Performance with quality tracking**
   - Mitigation: Optimize critical paths, allow quality/speed tradeoff

3. **Integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Strong service boundaries, clear interfaces

### Timeline Risks:
1. **11 weeks aggressive**
   - Mitigation: MVP focus, defer nice-to-haves
   
2. **Unknown unknowns**
   - Mitigation: 20% buffer in each phase

## Success Criteria

The implementation succeeds if:

1. **Handles mock workflows**: Can execute examples from our 37 scenarios
2. **Maintains quality**: Every result has confidence/provenance
3. **Flexible formats**: Seamlessly converts based on analysis needs
4. **PhD ready**: Sufficient for thesis demonstration
5. **Extensible**: Clear path to add remaining tools

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Week 1, Day 1-2**: Create BaseObject and core data schemas
2. **Week 1, Day 3-4**: Implement IdentityService with three levels
3. **Week 1, Day 5**: Set up Neo4j with versioning schema
4. **Week 2, Day 1**: Create MCP server framework
5. **Week 2, Day 2-3**: Implement reference system
6. **Week 2, Day 4-5**: Create first tool (T01) with all requirements

This roadmap incorporates all discoveries from mock workflows while maintaining focus on PhD thesis requirements. The three-level identity system and universal quality tracking are the key innovations that enable everything else.
