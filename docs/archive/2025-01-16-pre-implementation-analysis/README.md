# Pre-Implementation Analysis Archive

**Archived**: January 16, 2025  
**Reason**: These analysis documents were created during the design evolution phase and contain outdated references to the 106-tool architecture. They have been archived to prevent confusion with the final 120-tool specification.

## Important Note

The authoritative specifications are now in:
- `/docs/core/SPECIFICATIONS.md` - 120 tools in 8 phases
- `/docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Final architecture with three-level identity
- `/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Current implementation plan

## Historical Value

These documents contain valuable design evolution history:
- Mock workflow analyses that led to the three-level identity system
- Tool compatibility explorations (though based on 106 tools)
- Requirements synthesis that justified the addition of T107-T120

However, they should NOT be used as implementation references.
