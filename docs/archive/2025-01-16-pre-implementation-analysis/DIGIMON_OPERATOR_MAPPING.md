| **Layer** | Return communities below required layer | **T73** (Community Detection) + **T52** (Global Search) | Hierarchical community access |

## Why I Initially Missed Some

I focused on the most distinctive operators and didn't enumerate all variants. The complete mapping shows:

1. **Some operators appear in multiple categories** (e.g., VDB for both entities and relationships)
2. **Our tools often combine multiple operator functions** (e.g., T56 handles multiple similarity-based operations)
3. **We need some enhancements**:
   - T75 should explicitly support Steiner tree
   - T19 (Co-occurrence Analysis) is perfect for the Occurrence operator
   - Some operators need tool combinations

## Key Insights from Complete Mapping

### 1. Coverage Analysis
- ‚úÖ **18/19 operators fully covered** by existing tools
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 operator needs enhancement**: Steiner tree (T75)
- üí™ **Many tools serve multiple operators**: Shows our design flexibility

### 2. Tool Combinations for Complex Operators
```python
# Example: AgentPath implementation
def agent_path_operator(start_entities, end_entities, question, k=3):
    # Step 1: Find all k-hop paths (T54)
    all_paths = T54_path_finding(start_entities, end_entities, max_hops=k)
    
    # Step 2: Use LLM to score path relevance (T87)
    scored_paths = []
    for path in all_paths:
        relevance = T87_text_classification(
            text=serialize_path(path),
            categories=["relevant", "irrelevant"],
            context=question
        )
        scored_paths.append((path, relevance["relevant"]))
    
    # Step 3: Return top paths
    return sorted(scored_paths, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]
```

### 3. Operator Categories ‚Üí Tool Phases
- **Entity Operators** ‚Üí Phase 4 tools (T49-T67)
- **Relationship Operators** ‚Üí Phase 2 & 4 tools
- **Chunk Operators** ‚Üí Phase 1 & 4 tools  
- **Subgraph Operators** ‚Üí Phase 4 & 5 tools
- **Community Operators** ‚Üí Phase 5 tools

### 4. Missing Tool Opportunities
Based on DIGIMON operators, we could add:
- **T107**: Relation Normalizer (as discussed)
- **T108**: Steiner Tree Extractor (explicit implementation)
- **T109**: Operator Composer (combine operators into methods)
- **T110**: Score Aggregator (unify different scoring methods)

## Implementation Priority Based on DIGIMON Methods

Looking at which operators are used by popular methods:

1. **High Priority** (used by 3+ methods):
   - VDB (Entity & Relationship)
   - PPR
   - Onehop
   - KhopPath

2. **Medium Priority** (used by 2 methods):
   - Agent
   - Aggregator
   - FromRel

3. **Low Priority** (used by 1 method):
   - RelNode
   - Link
   - TF-IDF
   - Steiner
   - AgentPath
   - Occurrence
   - Entity/Layer (Community)

This mapping provides a complete blueprint for implementing any DIGIMON method using our tools!
