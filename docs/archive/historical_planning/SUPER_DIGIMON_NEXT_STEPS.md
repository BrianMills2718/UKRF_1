# Super-Digimon Next Steps

## Immediate Next Steps (Pre-Coding)

### 1. **Extract Operator Requirements from JayLZhou GraphRAG**
**Why Critical**: Can't implement operators without knowing their attribute requirements.

**Action**: Analyze JayLZhou/GraphRAG codebase to document:
- Required attributes for each of 26 operators
- Optional attributes
- What attributes each operator produces
- Compatibility with graph types (Tree, KG, TKG, RKG, Passage)

**Deliverable**: `OPERATOR_SPECIFICATIONS.md` with complete requirements

---

### 2. **Create Synthetic Test Dataset**
**Why Critical**: Need test data for development and validation.

**Action**: Create fictional "Celestial Council" dataset with:
```python
/test_data/celestial_council/
  small/       # 100 nodes
    - users.csv
    - relationships.csv  
    - posts.csv
    - documents/
  medium/      # 10K nodes
    - (same structure)
  large/       # 1M nodes
    - (same structure)
```

**Deliverable**: Test data in multiple scales

---

### 3. **Define Development Checkpoints**
**Why Critical**: Replace timeline-based planning with concrete milestones.

**Action**: Create clear checkpoint definitions:
- Remove all timeline references
- Define success criteria for each checkpoint
- Create test cases for validation

**Deliverable**: Update all documentation to use checkpoints instead of weeks

---

### 4. **Docker Development Workflow Decision**
**Need**: Clarification on Docker setup for development

**Options**:
- Hot reload setup
- Volume mounting strategy  
- Cache management
- Git integration

**Deliverable**: `DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT.md` with chosen approach

---

### 5. **Agent Architecture Design** (Can be deferred)
**Status**: Deferred to final pre-planning stage per user preference

**When Ready**: Design how agent:
- Decomposes natural language queries
- Selects appropriate tools
- Handles failures
- Maintains context

---

## Implementation Order (After Pre-Planning)

### Checkpoint 1: Basic Pipeline
- GraphData, TableData, Document classes with attributes
- Storage service (filesystem + JSON)
- 3 basic tools (csv_load, graph_build, simple_query)
- Basic pipeline execution
- End-to-end test: CSV → Graph → Query

### Checkpoint 2: Core Operators  
- 10 core operators with requirements
- Pipeline DSL parser (Pydantic-based)
- Context passing system
- Tool compatibility validation

### Checkpoint 3: Full Operator Set
- All 26 operators implemented
- Aggregate tool creation/storage
- Pipeline composition UI
- Scale testing to 1M nodes

### Checkpoint 4: Intelligence Layer
- Agent query decomposition
- Smart tool selection
- Failure recovery
- SME interaction patterns

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **OPERATOR_SPECIFICATIONS.md** - New file with all 26 operator requirements
2. **Remove timelines** from:
   - PRAGMATIC_MVP_PLAN.md
   - FINAL_SUPER_DIGIMON_ROADMAP.md  
   - IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md
3. **Add checkpoint definitions** to replace timeline references
4. **DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT.md** - New file with Docker workflow

---

## Critical Path

Must complete in order:
1. Operator specifications (blocks all implementation)
2. Test data creation (needed for checkpoint 1)
3. Checkpoint definitions (guides development)
4. Docker workflow (before coding starts)
5. Agent architecture (can wait until checkpoint 4)
