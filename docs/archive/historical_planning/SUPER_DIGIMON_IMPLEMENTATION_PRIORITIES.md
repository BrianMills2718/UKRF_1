# Super-Digimon Implementation Priorities

## Overview
Based on extensive critical analysis and dialogue, this document outlines the concrete implementation priorities for Super-Digimon, focusing on the most critical technical challenges that must be solved first.

## Critical Technical Gaps (In Priority Order)

### 1. **The Compatibility Matrix Implementation** (MOST CRITICAL)
**Why Critical**: This blocks everything else - tools can't compose without knowing compatibility.

**Simplified Approach**:
```python
# Data structures have attributes
class Graph:
    attributes = {'nodes', 'edges', 'node_id', 'edge_source', 'edge_target'}

# Operators declare what they need
class PageRankOperator:
    requires = {'nodes', 'edges', 'edge_source', 'edge_target'}
    produces = {'pagerank_scores'}

# Simple compatibility check
def can_apply(operator, data_structure):
    return operator.requires.issubset(data_structure.attributes)
```

**Deliverables**:
- Define attributes for Graph, Table, Document
- Define requirements for all 26 operators
- Simple transformation functions with attribute mapping
- Basic validation for semantic mismatches

---

### 2. **MCP Tool Interface Standardization**
**Why Critical**: Every tool needs consistent interface for composition.

**What Needs Building**:
```python
@mcp_tool
class StandardMCPTool:
    def get_compatibility_info(self) -> ToolCompatibility:
        """What structures can I work with?"""
        
    def estimate_resources(self, input_size) -> ResourceEstimate:
        """Will this fit in memory?"""
        
    def explain_parameters(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """SME-readable parameter explanations"""
        
    def get_attribute_requirements(self) -> AttributeRequirements:
        """What attributes do I need/produce?"""
```

**Deliverables**:
- Tool template/base class
- Compatibility declaration standard
- Resource estimation protocol
- Parameter documentation format

---

### 3. **First End-to-End Checkpoint**
**Why Critical**: Proves basic pipeline works without mocks.

**Test Flow**:
```
CSV → Graph → Simple Query → Result
```

**Requirements**:
- No mocks or simulation
- Real data loading
- Real graph creation
- Real query execution
- Full lineage tracking

**Deliverables**:
- Working checkpoint test
- Basic data structures implemented
- Simple transformation working
- Lineage system prototype

---

### 4. **Agent Memory Architecture**
**Why Critical**: Agent needs memory across tool calls.

**What Needs Building**:
```python
class AnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.working_memory = {}  # Current analysis context
        self.episodic_memory = []  # History of this session
        self.semantic_memory = {}  # Learned preferences/decisions
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Context window management
- Summarization vs full history
- State recovery patterns
- Memory persistence

**Deliverables**:
- Agent state management system
- Context overflow handling
- Memory persistence layer
- Integration with MCP tools

---

### 5. **Docker + MCP Development Environment**
**Why Critical**: Need consistent development/deployment environment.

**Requirements**:
- Hot reload for development
- MCP tool isolation
- Volume mounting for code changes
- Proper git integration (no image bloat)

**Deliverables**:
- docker-compose.yml configuration
- Development vs production configs
- MCP service architecture
- Volume management strategy

---

### 6. **Type Propagation System**
**Why Critical**: Pydantic types must flow through transformations.

**What Needs Building**:
```python
# Type-safe transformations with attribute tracking
def transform[T, U](
    source: T, 
    target_type: Type[U], 
    compatibility: CompatibilityRule
) -> Tuple[U, TransformationLineage]:
    """Type-safe transformation with lineage"""
```

**Deliverables**:
- Type-safe transformation protocol
- Attribute propagation rules
- Lineage type definitions
- Validation system

---

## Testing Strategy for Each Priority

### Testing Requirements:
1. **Unit Tests**: Components in isolation (pytest)
2. **Integration Tests**: Tool composition
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full pipeline via main.py
4. **Type Tests**: mypy validation
5. **Style Tests**: flake8 compliance

### Checkpoint Definitions:
```python
CHECKPOINT_1 = "Load CSV → Basic Graph → Query nodes"
CHECKPOINT_2 = "Graph → Community detection → Export communities"  
CHECKPOINT_3 = "Graph → Table → Statistical analysis"
CHECKPOINT_4 = "Full analysis → Aggregate tool → Reuse"
```

## What We're Explicitly NOT Doing (Scope Boundaries)

1. **Multi-user collaboration** - Single user assumption
2. **Fixed failure recovery** - Handled by agent adaptation
3. **Security/access control** - Not relevant for research prototype
4. **UI** - CLI first, UI last
5. **Evaluation metrics** - Deferred until system works
6. **Production deployment** - Docker for development consistency only

## Success Criteria

First Priority Success:
- Compatibility matrix design complete
- MCP tool template working
- First checkpoint passing

Second Priority Success:
- Agent memory system functional
- Docker environment stable
- Multiple checkpoints passing

Third Priority Success:
- Type propagation working
- 5+ tools integrated
- Complex transformations functional

## Architectural Decisions Made

See `SUPER_DIGIMON_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` for detailed decisions on:
- Simple attribute-based compatibility
- Shared storage service  
- Pass-by-reference pattern
- Pipeline DSL with progressive enhancement
- Explicit context passing
- Smart database routing

## The One Blocker - RESOLVED

**The Compatibility Matrix** - Decided on simple attribute-based approach where data structures have attributes and operators declare requirements.

## Next Immediate Actions

First Implementation Sprint:
1. Implement basic data structures with attributes
2. Create filesystem-based storage service
3. Build 5 core MCP tools with standardized interface
4. Implement simple pipeline DSL parser
5. Create first end-to-end checkpoint test

Focus: Get simple CSV → Graph → Analysis → Export working end-to-end with real data.
