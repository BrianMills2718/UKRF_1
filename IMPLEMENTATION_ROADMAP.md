# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the implementation phases for Super-Digimon, based on discoveries from 37 mock workflows and requirements analysis.

## Overview

**Goal**: Build a PhD thesis prototype that can perform virtually any analytical method through flexible data structuring and transformation.

**Core Innovation**: Three-level identity system + Universal quality tracking + Format-agnostic processing + Complete provenance.

## CRITICAL: Implementation Order

**The Core Services (T107-T111) in Phase 0 MUST be implemented first.** These services are foundational to the entire system:
- **T107 Identity Service**: Required by all entity-related tools
- **T110 Provenance Service**: Required by all tools for tracking
- **T111 Quality Service**: Required by all tools for confidence
- **T108 Version Service**: Required for reproducibility

No other tools should be implemented until these core services are operational.

## Implementation Principles

### Every Tool Must:
1. Track confidence and quality_tier
2. Use reference-based I/O
3. Support partial results
4. Record provenance
5. Handle errors gracefully

### Quality First:
- No operation without confidence score
- Uncertainty propagates through pipeline
- Users can filter by quality threshold
- Partial results better than no results

### Reference Architecture:
- Never pass full data between tools
- Storage systems handle persistence
- Tools work with data streams
- Graceful handling of large data

### Provenance Everything:
- Every operation recorded
- Complete lineage tracking
- Reproducibility guaranteed
- Impact analysis possible

## Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] Can convert graph ↔ table

### Analysis Validation:
- [ ] Can run PageRank with confidence
- [ ] Statistical analysis on graph-derived data
- [ ] Causal analysis with PyWhy

- [ ] Ready for thesis demonstration

## Success Criteria

The implementation succeeds if:

1. **Handles mock workflows**: Can execute examples from our 37 scenarios
2. **Maintains quality**: Every result has confidence/provenance
3. **Flexible formats**: Seamlessly converts based on analysis needs
4. **PhD ready**: Sufficient for thesis demonstration
5. **Extensible**: Clear path to add remaining tools

## Next Steps

1. Create project structure with src/, tests/, docs/
2. Set up development environment and dependencies
3. Implement BaseObject and core data schemas
4. Build IdentityService as proof of concept
5. Create first tool (T01) with all requirements
