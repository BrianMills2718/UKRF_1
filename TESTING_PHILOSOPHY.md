# Testing Philosophy - Real Systems Only

## Core Principle: No Mocks, No Simulations

Super-Digimon uses real databases and real data at every testing level. This ensures that if tests pass, the system actually works.

## Why No Mocks?

1. **Integration is the Value**: GraphRAG systems are about how components work together with real data
2. **Database Semantics Matter**: Mocks can't capture Neo4j's graph traversal behavior or FAISS's vector search nuances
3. **False Confidence**: Mock-based tests often pass while real integration fails
4. **Real Performance Data**: Only real databases show actual performance characteristics

## Testing Stack

### Real Databases for Testing
- **Neo4j**: Real graph database instance (via Docker or testcontainers)
- **SQLite**: Real file-based database
- **FAISS**: Real vector index operations
- **spaCy**: Real NLP models, not stubbed responses

### Test Data Strategy
```
test_data/
├── real_pdfs/           # Actual PDF files for testing
├── real_texts/          # Real text documents
├── known_graphs/        # Pre-built graph structures
└── expected_results/    # Known good outputs for comparison
```

### Test Environment Isolation
- Separate Docker containers for test databases
- Different ports (e.g., Neo4j test on 7688, dev on 7687)
- Clean database state between tests
- No shared state between test runs

## Test Categories

### 1. Component Tests
- Use real database instances
- Test individual tools with actual data
- Verify real outputs match expectations

### 2. Integration Tests  
- Complete data flows through multiple tools
- Real PDF → Real NLP → Real Neo4j → Real Query
- Verify data integrity at each step

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Full workflows from input to answer
- Performance measured on real operations
- Confidence scores from actual processing

## Example: Testing Entity Extraction

```python
def test_entity_extraction_realistic():
    # Real PDF file
    pdf = load_pdf("test_data/real_pdfs/research_paper.pdf")
    
    # Real NLP processing
    entities = extract_entities_with_spacy(pdf.text)
    
    # Real Neo4j storage
    with neo4j_test_instance() as neo4j:
        store_entities(neo4j, entities)
        
        # Real query verification
        result = neo4j.query("MATCH (e:Entity) RETURN e")
        assert len(result) == len(entities)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Catch Real Issues**: Integration problems discovered immediately
2. **Performance Reality**: Know actual processing times
3. **Confidence in Deployment**: What passes in test works in production
4. **No Mock Maintenance**: No need to update mocks when APIs change

## Tools We Use

- **pytest**: Test runner
- **testcontainers**: Spin up real databases for tests
- **docker-compose**: Orchestrate test environment
- **Real sample data**: Actual PDFs, texts, and graphs

## What We DON'T Use

- ❌ Mock objects
- ❌ Stub functions  
- ❌ Simulated databases
- ❌ Fake data generators (except for volume testing)
- ❌ In-memory database replacements

## Running Tests

```bash
# Start real test environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Run all tests against real systems
pytest tests/

# Cleanup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

This approach ensures Super-Digimon is tested against the same systems it will use in production, providing confidence that successful tests mean a working system.
