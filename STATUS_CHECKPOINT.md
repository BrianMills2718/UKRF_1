# Status Checkpoint - January 16, 2025

## Current State
- **Documentation**: Fully consolidated around 121-tool architecture
- **Core Concepts**: Three-level identity, universal quality tracking, format-agnostic processing
- **All Analysis Files**: Archived to prevent confusion with outdated 106-tool references
- **Ready for**: Implementation decisions based on external review

## Decisions Made Through Discussion

Based on thorough external review and discussion, we've agreed on:

### 1. Add T121: Workflow State Service
- Essential for crash recovery and reproducibility
- Lightweight checkpointing (just references)
- Called by orchestrator, not individual tools
- Enables complex, long-running workflows

### 2. Tool Contracts Are Essential
- Tools must declare required attributes, not just parameters
- Include required_state (e.g., "entities_resolved": true/false)
- Provide structured error codes for intelligent backtracking
- Enable programmatic pre-filtering of applicable tools

### 3. Vertical Slice Implementation Strategy
- Build one complete workflow first (PDF â†’ Answer)
- Validates entire architecture before horizontal expansion
- Forces early discovery of integration issues
- First milestone: "Successfully execute PDF-to-PageRank-to-Answer"

### 4. Entity Resolution as Analytical Choice
- Not all analyses need entity resolution
- Social networks: Keep @obama vs @barackobama separate
- Corporate analysis: Merge "Apple Inc." variations
- Tools declare their specific needs via contracts

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. Add T121 to SPECIFICATIONS.md (121 tools total)
2. Update COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md with tool contract specification
3. Restructure IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md for vertical slice first
4. Update examples to show resolution as optional based on domain

## Why This Checkpoint

External review identified critical architectural improvements. Before implementing these changes, we're creating this checkpoint to:
- Document the decisions made
- Enable rollback if needed
- Mark the transition from planning to implementation updates
