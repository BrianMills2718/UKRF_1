# Documentation Update Summary - January 16, 2025

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added T121: Workflow State Service
- Updated tool count from 120 to 121 across all documentation
- Added T121 specification in SPECIFICATIONS.md
- Updated Phase 8 to include T107-T121 (15 tools total)

### 2. Enhanced with Tool Contracts
- Added comprehensive "Tool Contracts" section to SPECIFICATIONS.md
- Updated COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md with contract-based tool selection
- Modified ARCHITECTURE.md to reference tool contracts as key decision

### 3. Restructured for Vertical Slice First
- Completely rewrote IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
- Changed from phase-based to vertical slice approach
- Target: PDF → PageRank → Answer in 2 weeks
- Emphasized minimal implementations before expansion

### 4. Made Entity Resolution Optional
- Added examples in ARCHITECTURE.md showing domain-specific choices
- Updated COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md with resolution examples
- Documented in tool contracts as "entities_resolved": "optional"

## Files Updated
1. `/home/brian/Digimons/docs/core/SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Added T121, tool contracts
2. `/home/brian/Digimons/docs/core/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` - Updated for 121 tools, contracts
3. `/home/brian/Digimons/docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated counts, added optional resolution
4. `/home/brian/Digimons/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Complete rewrite for vertical slice
5. `/home/brian/Digimons/README.md` - Updated tool counts
6. `/home/brian/Digimons/CLAUDE.md` - Updated counts and approach
7. `/home/brian/Digimons/STATUS_CHECKPOINT.md` - Fixed tool count

## Key Concepts Now Documented

### Tool Contracts Structure
```python
{
    "required_attributes": {...},
    "required_state": {...},
    "produced_attributes": {...},
    "state_changes": {...},
    "error_codes": {...},
    "performance": {...}
}
```

### Vertical Slice Milestones
- Week 1: Minimal core services
- Week 2: Build vertical slice tools  
- Week 3: Integration testing
- Week 4: Architecture review

### Entity Resolution Options
- Social networks: Keep separate (no resolution)
- Corporate analysis: Merge variations (with resolution)
- Tools adapt based on workflow configuration

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation with vertical slice
2. Create tool contract definitions for each tool
3. Build minimal versions first, expand later
4. Validate architecture before horizontal expansion
